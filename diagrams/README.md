### Wiring Explained

There's two images you see here in this folder. The main `wiring.png` should denote the general wiring of what's needed to create the smart IR controller. You can use any double sided PCB to do this.

The other, `breadboard_wiring.png` should denote how to wire everything _with a breadboard_. In my wiring diagram on my video, I did not make this distinction which I should have, so if you were to follow along with the video and try to hook everything up with a breadboard, it will not work for you. The updated diagram in this repo should be the one to follow if you are.

Apologies!
